# CyberLab_CRT-Royale_Death_To_Pixels_Shader_Preset_Pack

If you ever wished for a CyberLab Death To Pixels Easymode which had the Reflective Bezel turned off and filled the screen instead, that could perform better on lower end hardware and didn't have so many presets and folders but still gave an excellent quality CRT-Like experience, then perhaps this is exactly what you've been waiting for!


Installation:

To install these presets copy the "Shaders" folder into your "…\Retroarch\" folder (or whatever your Retroarch Root Folder is called).

Copy the "Filters" folder into your "…\Retroarch\" folder (or whatever your Retroarch Root Folder is called).

For NTSC Effects, like Blending of dithering and transparencies feel free to download my CyberLab Custom Blargg NTSC Video Filter Presets or use the ones that are already included in the Video Filters Menu or the Core Options of several Cores.

For my Turbo Duo presets my included "Blargg_NTSC_Turbo_Duo_SNES_RGB_CyberLab_Special_Edition_III.filt" video filter preset might be a good one to start with.

While for my Sega Genesis presets my included "Blargg_NTSC_Genesis_S-Video_CyberLab_Special_Edition_III.filt" or Blargg_NTSC_Genesis_Bad_Composite_CyberLab_Special_Edition_III.filt video filter preset might be a good starting points.

Note if there is no corresponding Core or CyberLab Blargg video filter preset recommendation for that system, no recommendation exists.


1440p users can probably try the Fine presets. They might work. Otherwise just play around with the "Mask - Triad Size Desired" Shader Parameter.

1080p users can probably set the "Mask - Triad Size Desired" Shader Parameter to 3.00. Otherwise just play around with it until it looks good to you or just use the new 1080p presets which are now available!


I doubt I would have made these presets if it weren't for the postings and comments of Hyllian in the "Please show off what CRT shaders can do!" Libretro Forums thread so he deserves a Special thanks.

Also for the fact that these presets originally used his as a starting point.

Special thanks also to all the other shader creators including TroggleMonkey and hunterk who made this all possible.



Enjoy!
